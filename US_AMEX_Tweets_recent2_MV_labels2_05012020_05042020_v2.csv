Disappointed with Amex. Been a customer for 16yrs. Due to COVID I was late on my pymt by about 2 weeks. Not over 30 days. Made a $10k pymt yesterday and immediately after that AMEX reduced my credit limit 40%. Terrible service to small business at a time like this.,-1
Not good and really not helpful. I had to physically mail in the dispute paperwork because the website does not allow downloading or emailing or have real humans to talk too. You all are too big and now I’m looking for a new CC company. Amex handles these issues via chat.,-1
"30 year AMEX Platinum member receiving the worst service imaginable. Platinum travel has Incompetent people working. Flight changed, cannot make tour in time, AMEX will not refund points or money",-1
This is very disrespectful to your customers. You guys are suspending access to accounts and then not allowing people to connect to anyone on your end to solve the issue. I had fraud on my account and in return it was locked without my permission.,-1
"trying to be sneaky & cancel my auto pay without letting me know , then charging me a late fee. Trying to make up the losses by screwing ur customers? Not happy",-1
What has happened to you? You've been my favorite card. You seemed to have lost that edge. So disappointed. Large companies performing poorly.,-1
Hmm... Him: *holding her envelope from Amex* it’s a shame that AmEx wasn’t able to fulfill your request to go paperless. Must be a processing failure on their end. *narrator* He avoided a potentially painful exit with verbal agility,-1
Great so now my AMEX card is due and I've got to either pay it $400++ and sit on these items or pay you $$ to return the items. I love you but that's ridiculous. This is good-bye. (PS - I've been a card holder since 2006!),-1
"I've bought everything on my Amex for years, still have not found one good time to use the points. The whole credit card rewards game is a scam.",-1
"Have tried multiple times with different credit cards (visa and amex) to make account purchase. Transaction continually fails. Banks say ""there's no problem on their end, it is on the merchant side"". Are you having cc transaction problems??",-1
I've been trying to get through to American Express for days. They finally take my call. Them hang up on me as soon as I tell them what the problem is. Now they are not accepting calls again.,-1
"Assurance has failed at the one job it had to do, INSURE MY FLIGHT! Since filing my claim a month and a half ago, still no resolution and my flight is supposed to leave tomorrow. Do not use AMEX Assurance flight insurance. TERRIBLE!!!",-1
Amex has become the worst in customer service with COVID-19. Other issuers like Chase are giving fee breaks etc because premium cards aren't so useful when you can't travel. Amex is so greedy they won't give you a break on the Platinum card when you can't use,-1
"Market Snapshot: S&P 500, Nasdaq cling to slight gains but head for weekly loss, as investors weigh earnings, coronavirus outlook",-1
"Already filed complaint with against . Soon to file complaints against . Not only is in the wrong from a legal standpoint, but this is a terrible way to treat customers during a pandemic!",-1
"has been absolutely AWFUL. Spent TWO hours on customer service Friday on a payment plan, and they cut me off AGAIN",-1
do you support this? Ticketmaster is a joke. My event is in may in Canada the border is closed until June & they refuse to issue a refund during an awful time. Its sick and disgusting. Even if it was played I cant attend the border will be closed,-1
"In a time when most companies are helping their customers, you have failed. I struggled but paid my bill in full, and the following day my membership fee showed up. Customer service was not flexible and said no way they could waive the fee. FAIL",-1
"major fail - placed order, was cancelled for no reason 45 minutes later, restaurant had no idea why, and Uber cash including AmEx platinum monthly bonus not immediately returned. Off to seamless I went. First time using and major disappointment.",-1
i was denied PPP because you still have me noted as deceased. I wrote a complaint to and you admitted the mistake. but you refused to change it. lied,-1
To the Gold card. Pretty disappointed. AMEX has always been NUMBER ONE in my opinion when it comes to customer service. Chase even is offering $100 credits on the Sapphire card due to Covid. Super disappointed and let down that AMEX wouldn’t work with me outside of downgrading.,-1
"Whatever you do, don’t have your tax return $ put in an Serve account. When you call for assistance, they won’t even take your call and they don’t offer online chat or email either. If you need help, you’re screwed. Sigh.",-1
Hey - what's the point of insurance if people get ignored when they need help and then hear a bunch of bs when they try to sort it out later? deserves compensation from you. Stop wasting her time with nonsense responses.,-1
WOW way to make COVVID-19 worse- refusing to waive annual membership fees when people have lost their jobs. Guess you don’t care about your customers as much as you say you do...,-1
you are withholding payment to a mother of 3 during COVID. Your service is not helpful. I sent funds to my vendor and it’s being held by you. Having deal with this as your service is absolutely awful,-1

"Just tried to cancel one of your cards. Rep said even though I haven't used it, I still have to pay next year's annual fee cause I called a few days too late. Shameful policy during a lockdown. 28 year customer. Never again.",-1
"but not after getting nowhere. Just poor service, AmEx. Disappointed beyond what I'd ever expect with such a prestigious company.",-1
I am upset with how irs is handling stimulus I still haven’t recieved anything and I set up direct deposit but Jackson hewitt Amex serve cards must not want to help customers sad to say I will not be filing with them again,-1

"Unless mi have like some 20k in them... holding out right now isnt worth it... prefer to pay off mi likkle debts so they dont become big debts, side note if amex mail u nu card cut it up",-1
"Just to drive this home. It is not my idea of a good time to spend 2 hours of my evening speaking to 6 different agents who are all ""sorry"" that this is not the ""experience American Express intends"" for me. This is a crash and burn customer experience. Yikes.",-1
You do know that's impossible right. Nobody is taking calls. Stop giving out this advice. Its terrible.,-1
I put it in a high yield amex savings account. Kinda wanna spend it on some dumb shit,-1
Just cancelled my account after many years of being a Delta Reserve Member. Your refusal to side with your customers SXSW is disgusting. So much for AMEX's legendary consumer protection. At least I got half of my money back via refund of your exorbitant $550 fee.,-1
Alright go ahead and run my card on May 1st per your misguided (to put it mildly) reopening plan. I blocked your future charges with . I was able to chat w/ a rep immediately & she even inquired as to my health & safety -- imagine that!,-1
"wait, so the only way I can update my User ID for is to ""cancel your current online account and re-register with a new User ID""? Really? This seems like a simple feature for your IT team to tackle in 2020! Update your Web Product Roadmap.",-1
Hey been waiting for almost a month for a refund on a damaged item you sent. Customer service was useless so did chargeback on . You have just lost a customer...,-1
I should’ve put the chipotle bowl I just had on my Amex. That way I could’ve disputed that nasty ass shit I just ate.,-1
Really starting to question whether the giant corporation that is AmEx has its shit together as I am waiting on hold to speak to the 4th person of the night after trying to resolve an issue that I've been calling about since DECEMBER. Close to losing me.,-1
I don't know. It was a bullshit post I let out. I doubt I can maintain an Amex. But this 2nd CC would be for emergencies,-1
"my fucking flashlights not working on my iPhone all of a sudden; Amex won’t pick up phone; I’m hungry for salmon, rice, and eggs.",-1
No need to reply. Amex made me make a payment and received one in the mail. Bad customer service during this time means changing credit cards. Adding stress during this time is unacceptable.,-1
"Dear You brand of ""support"" for small businesses during this crisis is abyssmal. Pulling the rug out from underneath someone you admit is a good risk, now?. WTH is wrong with you guys? See ya!",-1
Girl Amex is gone be like “bitch would u like it in the form of statement credit or a refund to your bank” .. instantly. Lol trash.,-1
I have a question. How long does it take for american express serve to send back my federal tax refund? My card got suspended for what reason? Have no idea! I need to know because this is my money you guys are playing with! I will speak to my lawyer. CantHoldMyMoney,-1
"and to make matters worse, after over an hour on the phone - all of the sudden the hold music stopped and I was hung up on. I've used y'all as a best practice for customer service, but you've broken my trust in really damning ways for your company.",-1
cancelled arbitration & sent the case back to court. THE CASE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE FORWARD AS AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS NO RIGHT TO SUE TO BEGIN WITH DAHHHHHH CLURT HAS AS I ANTICIPATED ALREADY BEEN UNFAIR AS I FILED SUITS AS I AM FED UP WITH BEING FUCKED IN A WAY I DO NOT ENJOY,-1
How long is this shit suppose to go on?! Can’t even get gas. And I can’t transfer money or do a cash pickup,-1
Ppl who use American Express Serve/Bluebird accounts havent had access to their money since last Wednesday. Not even access to our regular money that we already had in there. They closed their customer service down as well and Amex is just saying 'oops our bad we lost your money',-1

still can’t get through to it has been DAYS. No one answers and the app and site aren’t working. People have bills to pay,-1
The point is that neither relevant market or market share is a platonic truth. They depend on the conduct at issue. An overlooked problem with the AMEX decision is not that the Courts botched detour into economics obfuscated rather than clarified the central issue.,-1
